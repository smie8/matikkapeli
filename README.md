# Matikkapeli

Welcome to the Matikkapeli! This is a simple console-based math game designed to test your arithmetic skills. 
The game was planned by my 7-year-old kid, and implementation was done by me.
The game generates random math problems, and you score points by answering them correctly.

## How to Play
1. Compile the program and run it from the command line:
  a. `javac Matikkapeli.java`
  c. `java Matikkapeli`
2. You will see a math problem displayed on the screen (e.g., `5 + 3 =`).
3. Type your answer and press Enter.
    - If the answer is correct, you score a point.
    - If the answer is incorrect, the game will display the correct answer and you will not score a point.
4. To quit the game, type `lopeta` and press Enter.
